            <p>I am currently on exchange
                at the University of Colorado Boulder as
                part of my first year in the Masters
                program. I study software engineering.
                I received my bachelor's degree in Informatics
                from the Norwegian University of Science
                and Technology (NTNU).
            </br></br>
                Growing up, I lived in both Oslo, Norway and
                the Bay Area, California. I attended
                high school both places but received
                my high school diploma from Oslo
                Handelsgymnasium in 2014.
                </br></br>
                I have throughout my life always been
                seeking to do well academically. I am an
                intellectual curious person, and tend to
                grasp most academic challenge coming my
                way. I always strive to do my best –
                whether it be working independently or
                with fellow students. I look upon myself
                as a team player – someone who gets
                along well with all kinds of people.
